FIRE EMBLEM RECREATION -- Version Log

*** Version 0.01 ***
  Version Description: The current program has no implemented Fire Emblem assets. The program displays a cursor on
the console that flashes and can be moved in steps upwards, downwards, rightwards, or leftwards.
  
  Version Changes:
  - Initial code created.
  - Researched how to work with time in java, and the system method "nanoTime()" was implemented.
  - Established a clock, and a flashing cursor that can be moved with arrow keys.
  - DISCLAIMER: All imported material is from the sample folder "Programs with graphics". This folder was used to
attain a basic understanding of the "hsa_ufa.Console" class, but no code was taken and all code in this file was
written by Vicente Marin-Marquez. Some names such as "c" for the console and "key_code" were inspired by the content
of the folder, but no lines of code were plagiarized.

*** Version 0.02 ***
  Version Description: This version includes a displayed map cursor without any functionality
 
  Version Changes:
  - First class created: Map_cursor
  - The class "Map_cursor" was created from the pre-existing code for the cursor in the main method.
  - The class "Map_cursor" got a default constructor and one with parameters which is used in the program. 
  - The class "Map_cursor" got the "check_inputs" method which updates the position of the cursor (and will carry out
any other processes that require input keys) when given the current and last keys pressed.
  - The class "Map_cursor" got the "draw" method which draws its own image when it should.
  - The code for displaying images onto the console (the synchronized code) has been simplefied to calling the
respective objects so they draw their own image.
  
  - All classes now have a "x" and "y" value that corresponds to their coordinates by grid mark. They now draw their
images using a variable "pixels_per_grid" that lets them calculate where on the screen to draw their image.
  - The class "Map_cursor" cannot exceed the console boundraries.
  
  - Added an image displayed as terrain for the map.

*** Version 0.03 ***
 Version Description: This version includes a unit with no current functionality.

 Version Changes:
 - Class created: Map_unit
 - The class "Map_unit" was created from the code of the class "Map_cursor", and currently is not very distinct. It
will gain statistics and properties used in some of the main mechanics of fire emblem later.

 - The main method has been slightly organized and some temporary code has been added to test out how to deal with
ArrayLists of Instances before more general code that reads chapter data is implemented.

*** Version 0.04 ***
 Version Description: This version includes better management of the battle map and animations for the cursor and
units.

 Version Changes:
 - Class created: Map_mod
 - Gave all interactions and procedures in the battle map to the class "Map_mod".
 - The images of "Map_cursor" and "Map_unit" were replaced by animations, and their draw methods now support
animation with an array of images.

*** Version 0.05 ***
 Version Description: This version includes multiple animations and a semi-functioning map cursor.

 Version Changes:
 - Created the variable game_state that keeps track of what procedures the program should be doing (i.e. Title screen,
World map, Battle map, ...)
 - The main method has been split into the title screen and battle map game_states. The title screen is blank.
 - The images for animations in "Map_cursor" and "Map_unit" have been organized into 2D ArrayLists, where each
individual ArrayList contains the images for an animation.
 - The "Map_unit" class now reads in its animations from the "unit_data" text file, where each unit is given their
own section of information.
 - The "Map_cursor" class now interacts with "Map_unit" instances by communicating with the units it is hovering over
and the one it has selected.
 - The "Map_unit" class now shifts its image up if it is being hovered over and plays a different animation if it has
been selected.

 - The classes "Map_cursor" and "Map_unit" no longer have the "fps" and "p_per_grid" variables, so they instead use
the corresponding variable from their (map) moderator.
 - The classes also use variables such as the camera offset and the ArrayList of units from the (map) moderator.
 
*** Version 0.06 ***
 Version Description: This version includes multiple animations and a semi-functioning map cursor.

 Version Changes:
 - Allowed the "Map_mod" class to create a map from a text file, creating the appropriate player and enemy units.
 - Gave the "Map_unit" class variables for the character they represent, the class they are, and what side they 
affiliate with.
 - Changed some animation times and the frame rate of the game to 60 frames per second.
 - Updated map animations to a standard size of 60 x 60 pixels, and added the animations for a brigand.

*** Version 0.07 ***
 Version Description: This version includes units that display their movement range with blue tiles.

 Version Changes:
 - Added the images for tiles, that currently do not have a set depth in the map (they may be ontop or below units)
 - Added a terrain section in the map_data file that the map moderator reads in.
 - Selected units now display their proper movement range with blue tiles.

*** Version 0.08 ***
 Version Description: This version includes an arrow that connects a unit to the movement tile the cursor is
moving it to.

 Version Changes:
 - Added the images for the arrow, which is above the movement tiles but below the units.
 - Fixed the depth of the movement tiles so that they are above the terrain, but below the arrow.
 - Changed code for creating the movement tiles.
 - Created code in the map cursor class to create and draw the arrow when appropriate.
 
*** Version 0.09 ***
 Version Description: This version now has some text, in an aethetically similar font.

 Version Changes:
 - Added the "Text_constructor" class which deals with any text that needs to be displayed.
 - Credit to Peter Walser for giving an example of how to combine BufferedImages;
This is the link to his code: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2318020/merging-two-images
which was implemented in the "create_text_img" method of the class "Text_constructor".
 - Gave a "Text_constructor" instance to the "Map_moderator" class.
 
*** Version 0.10 ***
 Version Description: This version now has a changing map UI, displaying the terrain the cursor is hovering over
and some of its properties.

 Version Changes:
 - Added the "Map_ui" class which deals with the UI on the map.
 - Gave the image of the UI the "Map_ui" class.
 - The cursor now calls the method "update_ui" in the "Map_ui" instance, to update the image of the UI.

 - Added 2 new fonts.

*** Version 0.11 ***
 Version Description: This version contains an almost functional game. Units can be selected and moved, and they
show, but do not execute, actions on the UI.

 Version Changes:
 - Added the "Item" class, which reads off its information from a file.
 - Added items to the "unit_data.txt" file, granting playable units items from their first apperance.
 - Updated the "Map_ui" class to check for inputs and act acoording to them.
 - The UI now shows the a list of actions that the player can choose from for a unit that they have moved.

 - Gave the main class "Fire_Emblem_Recreation" a static "current_time" that all instances can reference.
 - Gave all of the Files to "Fire_Emblem_Recreation" so all instances can read them.

*** Version 0.12 ***
 Version Description: This version contains the basic menu mechanics, but still does not perfrom combat.

 Version Changes:
 - The Item action in the UI now displays the inventory of the selected unit, but does not do anything.
 - The Attack action in the UI now displays what will be the combat forecast, but it is empty.
 - The Wait action grays out the unit but does not switch the phase, essentially stopping the game.

 - Added the mountain terrain.
 - The map now starts out with only one player unit.
 
*** Version 1.00 *** Pre-Alpha
 Version Description: This version contains a buggy, yet functional version of the game. It only has one level and
one character, but that is enough.

 Version Changes:
 - The Item action now equips weapons
 - The Attack action is now functional and performs combat (without any animations). Player units gain experience
from battle. Units can die from battle and will disappear from the map if they do.
 - Player units that reach 100 experience will level up and have a chance of increasing each stat on level up.
 - Units that have acted cannot act until the next phase.

 - The game now switches phases when all units have acted.
 - The enemy now has an AI that moves its units if there is a player unit within range.

 - Basic title, victory, and Game Over screens have been added. When all units have been defeated, the victory screen
appears. When all players units have been defeated, the Game Over screen appears.

*** Version 1.01 *** Pre-Alpha
 Version Description: This is a revised version of the 1.00 Pre-Alpha release. Many bugs have been fixed, and some
features have been added.

 Version Changes:
 - There is now a slight delay before switching phases.
 - Created a path finding method in Map_mod that is now used by both the Map_cursor and Army_AI classes instead of
their independent algorithms.

 Bugs:
 - Fixed a bug that occasionally crashed the game after combat. Essentially the bug was that enemy units would
sometimes attack again after the player unit died, performing combat with a dead unit.

*** Version 1.02 *** Pre-Alpha
 Version Description: This is the first version on Eclipse Neon with no other major changes.

 Version Changes:
 - Renamed the class with the "public static void main" to Fire_Emblem_Recreation_Main and appropriately referenced it in the other files
 - Made a resource folder containing all of the images, fonts, and data files.
 - Made a resource path in the Fire_Emblem_Recreation_Main class that other classes use to find resource files.
 - All references to files now go through the above path.
 
 - Made the code in all classes and file format fit the Eclipse Neon format.
 
*** Version 1.03 *** Pre-Alpha
 Version Description:

 Version Changes:
 - Changed the way the class "Map_mod" reads the map_data.txt file, and added an error message for improper formatting.
 - Made all variables representing keyboard inputs static in the main class (such as key_char, time_code, ...) 
and added static methods to check if keys were just pressed.

 - Created a new class that moderates any combat called "Combat_mod" and gave all of the methods that perform combat to it.
 
*** Version 1.04 *** Pre-Alpha (October 6th to 10th, 2016)
 Version Description:

 Version Changes:
 - Made many of the methods in the combat moderator class static.
 - Many classes were made static, meaning that their methods and variables were made static. Some of
these classes include the "Map_mod", "Map_ui", and "Combat_mod".
 - The classes "Map_mod" and "Map_ui" are no longer initialized as instances so they has been given an initialization 
method, which is executed before the main loop for the game.
 - The class "Map_mod" has been given the "start_map" which is now used to start a map instead of creating a new instance.

 - Vulneraries have been added and can be used to restore 10HP when not at full HP, at the expense of a turn.
 Bugs:
 - (A bug fix for this bug seems to have been successful) !Sometimes enemies seem to attack twice!
 
 *** Version 1.05 *** Pre-Alpha (October 10th, 2016)
 Version Description:
 
 Version Changes:
 - Changed Combat_mod so that its methods now use static values, since only one combat takes place at a time.
This also allows it to keep track of the progress of combat over multiple frames.
 - Combat now takes place in rounds at different frames. Print statements have been added to display the events of each round.

 - Added forts and passive healing due to them.
 Bugs:
 -
